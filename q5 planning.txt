# Below represents (v1 ∨ ¬v2) ∧ (¬v1 ∨ v3)
clause_set = [[1, -2], [-1, 3]]

Want to iterate through the clause set and look at each clause seperatley.
The inner list represents OR, so if there is one True in that list then the clause evaulates to true.

We need to run through all truth assigments.
We therefore need a list of variables, e.g. representing v1, v2, v3
There are 2^n possible combinations to try.

Hence, itertools will come in useful! (Itertools.product?)
Itertools.combinations() (used here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/itertools-combinations-module-python-print-possible-combinations/) looks promising
