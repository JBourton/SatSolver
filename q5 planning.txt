# Below represents (v1 ∨ ¬v2) ∧ (¬v1 ∨ v3)
clause_set = [[1, -2], [-1, 3]]

Want to iterate through the clause set and look at each clause seperatley.
The inner list represents OR, so if there is one True in that list then the clause evaulates to true.

We need to run through all truth assigments.
We therefore need a list of variables, e.g. representing v1, v2, v3
There are 2^n possible combinations to try.

Hence, itertools will come in useful! (Itertools.product?)
Itertools.combinations() (used here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/itertools-combinations-module-python-print-possible-combinations/) looks promising
Find all the permutations of v1,v2,v3 in boolean form and identify if any TTTs are present; once a TTT is found, return combination and stop
Maybe all possible combinations of T and F can be [TF, 3]
Something like this, with items and boolean values might work: https://www.tek-tips.com/viewthread.cfm?qid=1796539

I can determine the number of variables by writing code that determines the number of unique elements in the list, less the -ve sign.

If each clause (line) contains at least 1 +ve number, then it must evaulate to True.
If all the clauses evaulate to True, the formula is satisfiable (because the clauses are AND'd together), and if not, return not satisfiable.

Could create a list that takes the clause_set and replaces 1, 2, 3 with T or F

I have a list of all unique variables (in test case [1, 2, 3]. Now I want to replace all instances of each unique variable with T or F.

globalVars = []
    for i in range(n):
        globals()[f'v{i}'] = variables[i]
        globalVars.append(globals()[f'v{i}'])

    globalVars[0] = True
    print(globalVars)

for variable in clause:
	print(variable)


Inside first while loop, create dictionary storing unique character as key and boolean value as the value.
The call the replace lambda using a lookup.

j = 0
while j < len(expression):
	clause = expression[j]
