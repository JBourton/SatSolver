Here is a Coursework Q&A:

Q: For question 5, should all satisfying assignments be returned?

A: No. Only one (or none).

Q: Can we assume the DIMACS instances use all variables in the range 1 to n where n is declared on the first line?

A: No.

Q: Can we assume that new clauses in DIMACS are on a new line?

A: Yes, for Windows, at least.

Q: Can we assume that there is a single space between literals and before 0 at the end of a clause?

A: Yes.

Q: Can we use libraries like numpy, itertools and copy?

A: Yes, but not more advanced libraries (like the SAT solver).

Q: What version of Python will you be running it on?

A: Most likely Python 3.7. It may be run on some other modern versions of Python 3 also.

Q: Can we assume literals are not repeated in clauses?

A: No.

Q: Can we assume clauses never contain both a literal and its negation?

A: No.
